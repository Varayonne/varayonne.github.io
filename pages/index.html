			<p align="left"> The War of White Lions was fought by the Cannus Republic and Marsinia against the Vunneich Empire from 17 January 1901 to 27 August 1902 in the Giron-Trien region. The war started with the White Lion Rebellion in Marsinia against Vunneich leadership in the city of Pe Lanacos. 
			Thousands of people took to the streets to protest Vunneich leadership. After the Coalition Wars, Vunneich annexed Marsinia, a series of islands North East of Cannus. From early on, Marsinian nationalists opposed the rule. The White Lions were formed to fight against, protest, and rally other Marsinians into taking action. 
			The White Lion Rebellion started when the Marsinian Peace Party put forth the third petition to the Vunneich Empire for fair treatment, councilship status, and a fair state assembly. This was denied and effectively cut them off from political representation in the Vunneich Empire.</p>
			<h2>Background</h2>
               <p align="left"> 
			   The Coalition Wars ended in 1883 and resulted in a massive shift of territory in the Caidfyr region. The Vunneich Empire and Cannus saw massive shifts in land ownership. Vunneich acquired numerous minor states and put them under the rule of the Empire, much to the dismay and worry of Emperor Krandst's advisor, Verilda Littzer. 
			   Some of these states were granted councilship status, which gave them minor political representation in the Empire. One of the most important shifts was over the Giron-Trien Region. The Vunneich Empire acquired Marsinia, a small patch of islands North East of Cannus. Marsinia was considered a cultural relative to Cannus. 
			   The territory was famous for its production over Eirs crystals, magical stones that are important in the process of biological modifications and medicine.

			  </div>
			  </figure>
			   <p align="left"> 
			   Vunneich imposed new taxes on the Marsinians and offered little in the way of self-rule, particularly limited with the Empire appointed governor and their advisors. Though many Marsinians were opposed to the new leadership, the early stages of Empire rule showed some cooperation. By 1886, the Marsinian Peace Party requested councilship. 
			   The Vunneich Empire denied this request. With that, the Marsinians created a proposal in 1889 that requested a local independent assembly with Marsinian representation. The alternative was opening Marsinians up to governor status. Both of the requests were denied. 
			   </p>
			   <p align="left">
			   Tensions increased over increased poverty, disease, and territorial mismanagement leading up to 1896. As a result of the severe distrust between the Empire and its subject, Marsinians saw widespread protests under a group called the White Lions. The White Lions sought some cooperation with Vunneich, demanded some autonomy, and wanted to be a standing member in the council. 
			   They conceded to allowing Vunneich to continue military, diplomatic, and economic command over Marsinia. The protsests were backed by the Cannun government. Harsh and violent treatment against the protestors increased hostilities and worsened relations between Vunneich and Cannus when the foreign involvement was revealed. 
			   </p>
			   <p align="left">
			   By 1897, the Marsinian Peace Party made a second list of proposals and a bid for councilship status. This, once again, was denied. By this point, the White Lions saw a shift in their leadership and then demanded for full independence from Vunneich.
			   </p>
			   <p align="left">
				In 1900, the islands had massive boycotts against Vunneich products, occupied Vunneich governor land, and carried out widespread protests. Once again, the Empire responded with extreme violence and punishment. Cannus censured the Vunneich treatment of the people and enacted harsh sanctions against the country. 
				By 16 December 1900, the Marsinians made one last petition to Vunneich. The list of demands was yet again denied. 
			   </p>
			   <p align="left">
			   On 2 January 1901, over 1,000 White Lions fought in the streets, burned empire buildings down, and sieged the governor's manor. Cannus sent over 10,000 troops, under the command of Jeros Cattanio, to help the White Lions. The Marsinians declared independence two days later. The immediate result of the, declaration of independence, and Cannus's intervention was a declaration of war on 17 January, 1901.
			   </p>
			   <h2> Early Phases of the War </h2>
			    <p align="left">
				At the start of the conflict, Vunneich forces controlled territories in Kiräk, Privivalle, and Cantrovalle, as well as the fortresses Zwenhuddy and Uel Lefiaco. The fighting was limited to Marsinia only.
				Marsinian forces were poorly trained, poorly equipped, and were quick to retreat. Thus, they were easily pushed back south of Cantrovalle and Uel Lefiaco.
			   </p>
			   <p align="left">
				Jeros Cattanio knew that as long as Vunneich held Zwenhuddy, then the Lerzi river was as far as they were going to get to pushing Vunneich out of the country. 
				Thus, Cattanio's plan was to take back Cantrovalle, Uel Lefiaco, and Privivalle. He rallied forces to march towards Cantrovalle and beat the forces there with relative ease.
			   </p>
			    <p align="left">
				The small victory at Cantrovalle was shortly celebrated, as Vunneich troops arrived earlier than expected on 12th April, 1901. When they started marching south, Cattanio retreated down the Zalvu River.
				Cattanio received reinforcements a month later and continued marching back to Cantrovalle, but his army marched slowly and gave the Vunneich army enough time to build a strong defensive line.
			   </p>
			    <p align="left">
				On 23 April, 1901, the Second Battle of Cantrovalle began in the early morning. While the Marsinians outnumbered the Vunneich army, though only by a little, they failed to break the Vunneich defenses.
				After two days of fighting, the Marsinians retreated back down the Zalvu River. With this success, the Vunneich army continued to march towards Addzu and the Zalvuvalle.

               </p>
               <HR>
               <p align=left> The Corladien Republic is a country in the Caidfyr region. They have a large cultural, political, military, and economic influence on the world.
                  The country achieved the Majesty of Civilizations (a term referring to a state's ability to project power) in the 1860s with advanced military developments and political reforms.
               </p>
               <h3>Early History</h3>
               <p align=left> Much of the early history boils down to the formation of several Corisch tribes.  
                  The most dominant of these being the Royenne, Lananncor, and Edrieu. It took several decades for laws
                  to be codified and a more formal societal structure to form, but once it did, the Lananncors became
                  the leading tribe and eventually the leading dynasty for the crown. Ysoirre I was the first to crown
                  himself as King of the Corisch.

               </center>
               </h3>
               <ol class="alt">
                  <li>How do I make a submission?</li>
                  <i>In order to submit, your work must demonstrate adequate knowledge and respect for the world. Now, that doesn't mean we're going to ask you to take a test or anything, but if you add fully automatic laser guns, it's going to get declined.
                  You also must meet certain standards of quality when it comes to writing, which mainly comes down to the essentials, such as spelling, grammar, and whatnot. Everyone makes mstakes, so if it's small it will likely get edited. But if it's typo after typo after typo, you'll be asked to rewrite.</i>
                  </p>
                  <li>Do you own what I submit?</li>
                  <i>Nope, nope, and nope. What you write is 100% yours, forever. I can't take that away from you. Even if there are minor edits from others involved, you are still credited as the creator.</i>
                  </p>
                  <li>I'm writing and I wanted to know, is X,Y,Z technology/magic/item allowed?</li>
                  </p>
                  <i>This gets back into the "adequate knowledge" for making submissions. It's impossible to cover every little detail, but keep in mind that the tech is early 1900s. However, there are fantastical gadgets. If you are curious, it's best to ask on a case-by-case basis.
                  But remember that there aren't many fully automatic machineguns, there are no assault rifles, and cars are still a luxury. In this world, a lot of people still travel between landmasses by airships (which are also expensive, but tickets are cheap). This is because the world consists of suspended, floating islands. Lots of them.</i>
                  </p>
                  <li>Can I add X,Y,Z city/town/location/faction/gang? </li>
                  <i>The answer to this is most likely "yes." Again, ask if you're worried. As long as it isn't a faction that changes the power dynamics of the world, you're likely in the clear. If you're writing about conflict (wars, battles, fights) then be cautious. Don't introduce a major conflict that changes the geopolitical climate or anything.</i>
                  </p>
                  <li>What themes/genres are allowed?</li>
                  <i>This is a serious world. While you can make the occasional joke or jab, this isn't a comedic series. This isn't also one that lends itself to romance, but it may have romantic moments. This is mainly an adventure series with some action elements.
                  That said, we are not looking for gorefests or extremely sexual content. If there are three pages describing the details of a bullet wound, it's not going to get accepted. Themes can vary from war, science, psychology, the political and relatable socioeconomic strains a nation faces due to the worsening divide between the rich and poor. Almost anything, really.</i>
                  </p>
                  <li>How long should my story be?</li>
                  <i>We are looking for material in the short story range to around the novella range. Now, those words mean nothing, because websites can tell you varying amounts. So, for word counts, a minimum of 4k words and a maximum of 25k words.</i>
